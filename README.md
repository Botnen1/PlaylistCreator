# PlaylistCreator
A python script for creating new playlists based on genre, artist, years and moods
You will need to gain api access from spotify in order to use a script like this.
You will have to obtain some keys from their developer site and add them to a seprate file. The file is imported in the begining of the main file, and the variables contain the strings for the keys.
